# Changelog

## [1.1] - 2018-01-29
### Added
- [Command-line tool](https://github.com/oshyshko/uio/#command-line-tool)
- Support of separate credentials for multiple hosts/buckets based on URL prefix.
  Search for "Defining credentials for multiple fs and paths" in [Clojure API](https://github.com/oshyshko/uio/#clojure-api).
  This change is backward compatible with `1.0`, however the `1.0` way of specifying
  credentials is no longer documented and not recommended for use.

## [1.0] - 2017-25-07
